These simulations were created by Alex Holcombe are used annually by him at the University of Sydney.  In 2020, Simbrain 3.04 was used. The installation instructions are here: https://java.whatanimalssee.com

# Doing the tutorial

Once you have Simbrain open, go to File menu->Open Workspace File -> and navigate to:simulations:workspaces:courseMaterials:  within that folder you will see:
autoAssociatorPart1.zip
autoAssociatorPart2.zip 
chasing_part1.zip
chasing_part2.zip

Each of 1-4 above is a lesson. Follow the instructions in the DocViewerwindow that will pop up for each.

## Hints

* Make the Network window bigger so it is easier to click on neurons and synapses.
* Arrange the DocViewer and other windows so you can easily see the contents of all three.
* Move Blonde and Brunette to opposite corners of the screen. If they get lost off-screen, resize the window.
